# Asteroiditutka

This small project was created for Mimmit Koodaa-live coding. I'll add a link to the recording, when it is available.

## Development

1. Clone the project and step into the project directory
```
git clone git@github.com:eevajonnapanula/asteroiditutka.git && cd asteroiditutka
```
2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Remove `assetPrefix` from `next.config.js` for local development
4. Run the project with
```
